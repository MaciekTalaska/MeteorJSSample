This is very simple example to present how to create an MeteorJS (https://meteor.com) based application.
This project is part of the presentation given on NoSQL databases (focusing mainly on MongoDB) and MeteorJS applications: 
 - repo: https://github.com/MaciekTalaska/NoSQLMongoDBMeteor
 - html version of the presentation: http://maciektalaska.github.io/NoSQLMongoDBMeteor/index.html#/

This tiny app is a sample chat. It allows many people to connect to the same instance and talk to each other (so similar to having a chat-room, or chatting in IRC).

**Note:** this application uses legacy version of Meteor, which still used Blaze technology as the frontend. 

If you're curious, you may runt this application in 3 simple steps.

1. Clone this repo
2. Install meteor, following instructions given on https://www.meteor.com/install
3. cd <repo> & execute `meteor` command (first run may take a while as all dependencies have to be downloaded)

Open your webbrowser and go to: localhost:3000
